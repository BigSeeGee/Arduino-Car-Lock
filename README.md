Iâ€™ve uploaded the wiring diagram and code for a model demonstrating how a car locking system works using two Arduino Unos.
One Arduino serves as the remote with buttons for locking and unlocking, while the other Arduino acts as the receiver, waiting for commands and moving a servo to the correct position. 
They communicate using the 433 MHz frequency.
The Arduinos can be powered by 9V batteries or through their USB ports. 
This project was part of my bachelor's thesis research.
Feel free to use it!
