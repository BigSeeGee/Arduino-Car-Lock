Iâ€™ve uploaded the wiring diagram and code for a model demonstrating how a car locking system works using two Arduino Unos. <br/>
One Arduino serves as the remote with buttons for locking and unlocking, while the other Arduino acts as the receiver, waiting for commands and moving a servo to the correct position. <br/>
They communicate using the 433 MHz frequency. <br/>
The Arduinos can be powered by 9V batteries or through their USB ports. <br/>
This project was part of my bachelor's thesis research. <br/>
The comments in the code are in Slovak language. <br/>
Feel free to use it! <br/>
